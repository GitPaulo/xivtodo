        <h2>Add characters</h2>
        <p>
          To add one of your characters, you first find its Lodestone URL. You can find it by
          logging into
          <a
            href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >
            Lodestone</a
          >
          and searching for your character profile. Your Lodestone URL will look similar to this
          example:
          <span class="font-monospace">
            https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/32741501/
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have found your profile URL, you can input it in the
          <router-link to="/settings">Settings</router-link> page and then click the
          <b>Add character</b> button.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can add as many characters as you want, and switch between them at any time using the
          dropdown at the end of the main navigation bar.
        </p>

        <br />
        <h2>Enable public achievements</h2>
        <p>
          If you add a character and your encounter and questline completions aren't getting
          registered, likely the achievements are not set to public visibility for that character.
          You can verify this by logging into
          <a
            href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >Lodestone</a
          >, and then accessing the
          <a
            href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/my/setting/account/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >
            Account Management</a
          >
          section. From there, make sure <b>Achievements</b> is set to <b>Public</b> and click
          <b>Confirm</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once your achievements are public, you may need to re-add your character or refresh it via
          the <router-link to="/settings">Settings</router-link> page on XIV ToDo for it to take
          effect.
        </p>

          Daily and weekly checklists can be customized by clicking on the
          <b>Customize</b> button near the top right of the
          <router-link to="/checklist">Checklist</router-link> page. From there, you can add custom
          entries as well as hide entries that you don't want to see. To stop customizing, simply
          click the <b>Customize</b> button again.
